1. GitHub classroom intergratability checked. 

Can implement multiple languages and use Test cases to evaluate students.
However there is no api for Github Classrooms. So we have to use .csv to do the analysis

2. Wordpress setup for the development of website.

Wordpress gives free domain for development of websites, but with very limited number of features.
So we made our WordPress setup in a local environment (on localhost) and shared it among team members using a live link.
